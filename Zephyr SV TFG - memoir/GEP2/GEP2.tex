\subsection{Risk Management: Obstacles and alternative plans}
In the pursuit of this research project, we have identified several potential risks that may affect its execution. In this section, we discuss these risks, propose solutions, and provide estimates of possible consequences in terms of additional time and resources required.\\
\subsubsection{Project Timeline}

    \textbf{Risk:} Some tasks may have been underestimated and may take longer than expected for various reasons.\\
    \textbf{Proposed Solution:} It is crucial to monitor our progress and be aware of the expected development stage at any given time. This enables us to adjust our plans if necessary.\\
    \textbf{Possible Consequences:} In the worst-case scenario, we may require an additional 50 to 80 hours of labor.\\
    \textbf{Probability:} Low. We have already conducted a comprehensive field study during the document's preparation, allowing us to identify potential obstacles and adapt the project plan and scope accordingly.
    
\subsubsection{Computational power}

    \textbf{Risk:} The computer we have may not be powerful enough to handle the largest hypergraphs efficiently.\\
    \textbf{Proposed Solution:} In case our current setup proves insufficient, we will establish contact with the computing cluster of the Department of Computer Science to process more demanding cases.\\
    \textbf{Possible Consequences:} In the event of computational limitations, there might be a delay of multiple days. During this time, Task T2.4 might be affected. However, our project plan allows us to proceed with different tasks that do not rely on T2.4 as a predecessor. At worst, we anticipate a delay of 15 hours.\\
    \textbf{Probability:} Low. Early testing shows that the computer at our dispositions is sufficiently powerful.
    
\subsubsection{Integration Challenges}

\textbf{Risk:} Integration with the KEGG database may present challenges, including content and format discrepancies.\\
\textbf{Proposed Solution:} To address integration challenges effectively, we will implement the following strategies:\\
- Stay informed about updates to the KEGG database.\\
- Establish communication channels with the KEGG team if possible.\\
- Develop a flexible application architecture capable of accommodating changes as they occur.\\
\textbf{Possible Consequences:} Integration challenges may lead to additional effort and time spent on data processing and application adaptation. The extent of the consequences will depend on the nature and frequency of changes in the KEGG database. We expect a delay of up two 50 hours.\\
\textbf{Probability:} High. We have already identified several shortcomings in the data available that could impact Tasks T3.3 and T3.4.

\subsubsection{Inexperience with ILP:}

\textbf{Risk:} The author's limited experience with Integer Linear Programming (ILP) poses a potential challenge.\\
\textbf{Proposed Solution:} To overcome inexperience with ILP, we will adopt a proactive approach that includes:\\
    - Utilizing educational resources, such as online courses and textbooks.\\
    - Seeking guidance and mentorship from experts in the field.\\
    - Engaging in practical exercises to apply ILP concepts.\\
    - Collaborating with individuals experienced in ILP.\\
    - Committing to continuous learning throughout the project.\\
\textbf{Possible Consequences:} While there may be an initial learning curve, dedicating time and effort to gaining proficiency in ILP should mitigate potential challenges related to inexperience.
Some tasks may have been underestimated and may take longer than expected for various reasons. We may expect up to extra 20 hours.\\
\textbf{Probability:} Low. We already have a working model.
