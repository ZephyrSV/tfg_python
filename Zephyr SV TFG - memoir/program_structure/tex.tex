\section{Program Structure and Data Structure}
\label{sec:program_structure}

In this section, we will discuss the program structure and data structure used in our project. The program structure refers to the organization and arrangement of the code, while the data structure refers to the way data is stored and manipulated within the program.

\subsection{File Organization}
\label{subsec:file_organization}

In our project, we follow a structured approach to organize our files. We have divided our code into multiple files based on their functionality and purpose. This modular approach helps in better code management and improves code reusability.

The main file of our project is the \texttt{App.py} file, which serves as the entry point for our application. It creates an instance of   from \texttt{views/pathway\_selector.py},

We have separate files for different components of our application, such as \texttt{views/pathway\_selector.py}, \texttt{data\_processing.py}, and \texttt{visualization.py}. Each file focuses on a specific aspect of the application and contains related functions and classes.

Additionally, we have a separate folder for storing data files, named \texttt{data}, where we keep all the necessary data files for our application. This helps in keeping the project organized and makes it easier to manage and update the data.

By following this file organization approach, we ensure that our code is well-structured, modular, and easy to navigate and maintain.
