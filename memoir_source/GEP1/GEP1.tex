This article provides context for the research conducted in Zephyr Serret Verbist's Bachelor's Thesis, undertaken at the Faculty of Informatics of Barcelona (FIB) at the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya, under the guidance of Gabriel Valiente Feruglio. It encompasses an exploration of the research's background, the applied methodology, the rationale behind the study, and the obtained results.

\subsection{Terms and concepts used in this study}

\subsubsection{Hypergraphs}

Hypergraphs are an extension of graphs that employs hyperedges instead of edges. A hyperedge is defined by two non-empty sets of nodes: a tail set and a head set. The hyperedge models a relationship originating from all elements in its tail set to all elements in its head set, or it can be undirected.

Let us recall from~\cite{Gallo.Longo.Pallottino.Nguyen:1993} the following definition, where we impose the tail set and head set of a hyperedge to be nonempty sets of nodes.

\begin{defn}
A directed hypergraph $H=(V,E)$ consists of a set of nodes $V$ and a set of hyperedges $E=\{\ (T(e),H(e))\ \mid T(e)\ \subseteq\ V,\ H(e)\ \subseteq\ V,\ T(e)\neq\emptyset,\ H(e)\neq\emptyset\}$.
\end{defn}

\subsubsection{Metabolic Pathway}
A metabolic pathway is a set of linked chemical reactions that occur in the cell.
Hypergraphs are particularly well-suited for modeling metabolic pathways because metabolic reactions often involve multiple substrates and multiple products~\cite{Pearcy.Crofts.Chuzhanova:2014}. While these reactions typically have a dominant direction, it is also possible for some reactions to proceed in the opposite direction~\cite{SORRIBAS1989239}. Figure \ref{fig:hsa00600} shows a representation of the Sphingolipid metabolic pathway map in Homo Sapiens.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \label{fig:hsa00600}
\end{figure}

Throughout this study, we will utilize authentic metabolic pathways sourced from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. These real-world pathways will serve a dual purpose: firstly, to rigorously assess the effectiveness of our proposed solution, and secondly, to establish a robust benchmark against which future evaluations can be conducted. The determination of practical relevance and application of our results will be subject to evaluation by researchers in the field, ensuring the impartial assessment of our methodology within the context of real biological systems.

Using hypergraphs to model metabolic pathways allows us to capture the complexity and interdependencies inherent in cellular metabolism. This modeling approach provides a robust framework for studying and analyzing the intricate network of biochemical reactions that occur within cells, shedding light on the underlying processes crucial to understanding cellular function and regulation.

\subsubsection{Internal and external vertices} \label{sec:internal_external_definition}
In the context of directed graphs and hypergraphs, we introduce the concept of internal and external nodes. An internal node is defined by meeting two essential criteria: it must have an in-degree greater than zero, indicating incoming connections, and it must also have an out-degree greater than zero, signifying outgoing connections. Conversely, if a node fails to satisfy either of these criteria, it is considered external.

Applying this concept to a given metabolic pathway and its corresponding hypergraph, an internal node implies that the associated metabolite serves as both a substrate and a product within the metabolic pathway. In contrast, when a node is external, it indicates that the metabolite functions either as an input into the metabolic pathway or as a final product, thereby shedding light on the role of the metabolite in the broader context of the pathway's inputs and outputs.

\subsection{Problem definition}

In the context of undirected or partially directed hypergraphs, the objective is to determine an optimal orientation of the hyperedges that minimizes the number of external nodes. An external node is defined as a node within the hypergraph that lacks either incoming or outgoing hyperedges. To address this problem, we aim to develop an integer linear programming (ILP) model capable of finding a feasible solution within a reasonable computational timeframe.

In essence, this problem seeks to find an orientation for the hyperedges that maximizes the internal connectivity of nodes while minimizing their isolation as external nodes. The ILP model will serve as a valuable tool to achieve this goal, providing an efficient means of optimizing the orientation of hyperedges and facilitating the analysis of complex hypergraph structures.

The Figure \ref{fig:Hypergraph-orientation-example} shows two possible orientations of the hypergraph given in Figure \ref{fig:Hypergraph-example} and demonstrates the impact of the orientation on the number of external nodes.
The first orientation has 2 external nodes and the second one has 5 external nodes. The external nodes are highlighted in yellow. The first orientation is optimal in this case.

\end{list}

\section{Justification}
In the realm of network science and analysis, the topological characterization of complex networks has been a focal point of research and investigation over the past decade. However, the analogous theory for complex hyper-networks has not seen the same level of development and attention~\cite{Pearcy.Crofts.Chuzhanova:2014}. Notably, there exists a critical gap in the field: the lack of a known polynomial-time algorithm for the optimal hypergraph orientation problem, and the computational complexity of this problem remains an open question.

To address this challenge, we have made the deliberate choice to employ Integer Linear Programming (ILP) as our optimization technique. ILP offers a powerful and versatile framework for tackling complex combinatorial problems. Given the uncharted terrain surrounding hypergraph orientation, the adaptability and precision of ILP provides a promising avenue for addressing this computational challenge and advancing our understanding of complex hyper-networks. Through ILP, we aim to explore and optimize hypergraph orientations, thereby contributing to the development of solutions in this less-explored but highly significant area of network theory.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Methodology: Kanban for Solo Development} \label{sec:Methodology}

For this research project, the Kanban methodology has been selected as the ideal approach to guide the development process. 

\subsection{Adapting Kanban for Solo Development:}

In the absence of changing client priorities, Kanban will be customized to align with the solo development setting:

\smallsmalltitle{Visual Task Management:}

For efficient task management and to implement the Kanban methodology, we will leverage the Trello platform as my primary tool. Trello's user-friendly interface and visual board system make it well-suited for organizing and tracking the progress of research tasks. Within Trello, We will create dedicated boards that represent various project stages, such as ``To-Do", ``In Progress", and ``Completed". Each task or research activity will be represented as a card within the corresponding board column. This approach will provide a clear, real-time visualization of the project's workflow and enable me to maintain a structured and organized development process throughout the project's lifecycle.

\smallsmalltitle{Work in Progress (WIP) Limits:} 

Kanban's WIP limits will be employed to control the number of concurrent tasks in progress. By setting limits on work items, the development process is streamlined, preventing overloading and maintaining a manageable pace of work.

\smallsmalltitle{Continuous Monitoring:} 

Scheduled bi-weekly meetings with the thesis supervisor will serve as checkpoints for evaluating progress and addressing challenges. In addition, we will maintain consistent email communication with the supervisor. To enhance transparency and provide real-time access to project progress, all code will be hosted on a public Git repository. This repository offers version control, data backup in case of hardware failure, and potential future collaboration. It will feature a single main branch for streamlined development and marked releases to signify project milestones.

\smallsmalltitle{Feedback and Iteration:} A fundamental principle of Kanban is continuous improvement. Feedback obtained from supervisor meetings and self-assessment will guide adjustments to the project plan. This iterative approach allows for refinements in task prioritization and resource allocation as the project evolves.

\subsection{Benefits of Kanban for Solo Development:}

\begin{list}{}{\leftmargin=0em}
    \item \textbf{Efficiency:} Kanban promotes efficient task management, ensuring that effort is directed toward high-priority items.
    \item \textbf{Visibility:} The visual nature of Kanban provides a clear overview of project progress and pending tasks.
    \item \textbf{Adaptability:} Kanban's flexibility allows for seamless adjustments to the project plan based on evolving needs or new insights.
    \item \textbf{Reduced Overhead:} As a solo developer, Kanban minimizes the overhead associated with more complex project management methodologies.
\end{list}
