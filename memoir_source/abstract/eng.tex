Our focus was on formulating an AMPL model, enabling researchers to attain effective solutions through ILP optimization. Key contributions of our work encompass:

\begin{itemize}
\item Development of a logically robust model for solving hyperedge orientation in metabolistic pathways.
\item Benchmarking the model against alternatives, identifying strengths, weaknesses, and optimal application scenarios.
\item Introduction of additional constraints deemed significant in metabolistic pathways, including:
\begin{enumerate}[left=2em]
\item Prevention of inversion in specific reactions.
\item Identification of certain vertices as internal.
\item Identification of certain vertices as external.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

Additionally, this paper introduces a user-friendly GUI tool that facilitates model exploration, result analysis, constraint addition, and pathway orientation in real-world scenarios.
